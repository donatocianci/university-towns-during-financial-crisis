# Housing prices of University towns during the 2008 financial crisis
This project grew out of a project from University of Michigan's Introductory Data Science course offered through Coursera. 
This code scrapes a list of university towns from Wikipedia using BeautifulSoup. 
Using this list, housing data obtained from Zillow's research site and GDP data provided by the US department of Commerce,
we run a Student's t-test to test the hypothesis of whether the mean housing prices of University towns are less effected by an economic recession.
